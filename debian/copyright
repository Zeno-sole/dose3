 Some versions of this file had a copyright header claiming the file was

 This file only serves as a helper during compilation (it packs together all
 mli files into one file for ocamldoc) and its contents are not linked or
 otherwise copied into the final binaries. Thus, the final binaries of the
 dose3 packages are still distributed under the terms of the LGPL-3+.
